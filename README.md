# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

This is my attempt to do some Advent of Code challenges. I'm doing it in Python. First, I try my own way. After this, I
let AI try to improve my code. This can be found in the `ai` directory for each year. It may be stupid, but hey. It's
funny to see how bad my attempts may be.
